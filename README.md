# Avro4s Fork

This repository is an actively maintained fork of the original [avro4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s). Our fork focuses on supporting modern requirements—namely **Java 21**, **Scala 3**, and **Nix**—and may include changes that are not backward compatible with earlier Java or Scala versions.

## Disclaimer
You are free to copy any features or improvements from this fork back into the original avro4s project. Please note that this repository is optimized for our own production needs, so it may diverge substantially from the original.

## Why This Fork?
We created this fork to meet specific enterprise and client requirements that demand:
1. **Java 21 Support** (production-ready)
2. **Scala 3 Support** (production-ready)
3. **Nix Support** for reproducible builds and environments

These updates may introduce breaking changes for projects using older Java or Scala versions.

## Commercial Support
If your company is considering this fork for production, we can assist with both **adoption** and **migration**. Because each use case varies, pricing is arranged on an individual basis. For inquiries, please contact [Natural Transformation](mailto:zli@natural-transformation.com).

## Contributing and Issue Reporting
We welcome all contributions—bug reports, feature requests, and pull requests. Before contributing, please:
- Check existing [issues](../../issues) and [pull requests](../../pulls) to avoid duplication
- Ensure any changes align with this project’s focus on Java 21, Scala 3, and Nix support

We appreciate your feedback and help in making this fork even better!
