# A fork of avro4s

### Disclaimer

This repository is a fork of the original [avro4s](https://github.com/sksamuel/avro4s) project. It is not an official release and should not be considered as such.

#### Why This Fork Exists

This fork exists to accommodate specific needs and requirements for our company that could involve breaking changes from the original codebase. These changes may affect compatibility and could cause issues if you're expecting behavior identical to the original `avro4s` library. 

**Features:**
1. Nix support
2. Java 21 support


#### Use at Your Own Risk

While we strive to maintain high-quality code and robust functionality, this fork is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
